# Oracle-for-Shor
This repo contains my work in constructing an oracle for Shor's algorithm. The oracle is a function denoted cU_a(a, N). The inputs a and N are positive integers with a &lt; N, and the output is a (2n+3)-qubit quantum circuit that acts on the (n+1)-qubit quantum state $|x\rangle_1|y\rangle_n$ in the following way:
