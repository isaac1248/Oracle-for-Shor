# Oracle-for-Shor
This repo contains my work in constructing an oracle for Shor's algorithm. In the Jupyter notebook I implement the quantum circuit described in the paper "Circuit for Shor’s algorithm using 2n+3 qubits" by Stéphane Beauregard (2003). In particular, I define the function $cU_a(a, N)$, which takes in positive integers $a$ and $N$ such that $1<a<N$, and outputs the (2n+3)-qubit circuit $U$ that acts on the (n+1)-qubit quantum state $|x\rangle_1|y\rangle_n$ in the following way: $U|x\rangle_1|y\rangle_n = |x\rangle_1|ay \mod N\rangle_n$ if $x=1$ and $y<N$; otherwise, $U|x\rangle_1|y\rangle_n = |x\rangle_1|ay \mod N\rangle_n$. One important thing to note is that since the circuit consists of 2n+3 qubits, the output will be a (2n+3)-qubit quantum state, however the n+2 most siginificant bits can be ignored; that is, the n+1 least significant qubits will yield the output shown above.
